<b>Exercise</b><br>
 This data set (marten.txt ) consists of temperature data of different types of resting sites used by the American marten (a weasel like animal) during periods of deep snow and shallow snow.
<br>
<br><b>The first column is the type of structure used for resting:</b>

<b>Logs</b> – the marten rested under a decaying log
<br><b>Tree</b> – the marten rested in a hole in a tree
<br><b>Rocks</b> – the marten rested in a cavity in a pile of rocks.
<br>
<br>The second column is the temperature difference between the temperature inside the
structure and outside the structure in degrees Celsius. A positive number indicates that it
was warmer inside the structure than outside. The third column indicates whether the
snow was deep or shallow.
Write SAS statements to:

Bring the data into SAS using any method you like.
Create a new categorical variable for temperature differences greater than 0 and temperature differences less than or equal to 0
 Print the data.
Sort the data by one of the variables.
Generate descriptive statistics for temperature differences by structure type or snow depth.
Generate frequency tables for the new categorical variable for temperature differences and structure type and snow depth
